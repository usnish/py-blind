# Py-Blind
A little script that generates blinds and renames files in a data directory to help blind analysis.
I made this for my own use while analyzing images in wet lab.

Feel free to modify for your own use!

## To-do
Need to add un-blind functionality. Would be neat if blind.py actually produced this script, though I could just separate it and read from blinds.txt
